# dartsim

Just a simple darts match simulator I coded in my off-time for my own weird pleasures.

# To-do list

- Place the rules in a class and not global variables (those are bad)
- learn tkinter and add a gui to the program so I'm not just running it solely on the command line
- have the gui update scores and such as they play out (will either be very easy or super hard)
- add a screen where we can choose the rules in the gui instead of as a command line input
- add a screen where it displays the results in a nice screen that shows a list of the results and country flags (i like flags)
- have an ability to copy the results scores to a clipboard in a way that works with the spreadsheets i use to store the data
- have it be able to repeat from the results screen without running the program from scratch every time
- wrap it all in an exe or other executable format so i can run it on other computers and free up my coding comp to code new sims

i will forget all this
